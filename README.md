# Car Configurator - Brief Script Descriptions

_Assets/Scripts/EventManager.cs_<br />
The EventManager class contains all events used throughout the project. Most of these are invoked the user interacting with the UI, to which both the stage and the UI then react.

_Assets/Scripts/FaceCamera.cs_<br />
Can be attached to an object to keep it facing the camera regardless of the objects position and rotation. Only used in experimental component selector buttons (see ComponentSelector.cs)

_Assets/Scripts/GameManager.cs_<br />
Exits the game on ESC

_Assets/Scripts/NavDirection.cs_<br />
Defines directions for ui navigation (next/prev)

_Assets/Scripts/Stage/AccessoryPool.cs_<br />
Only used to tag the accessory pool object so that we can find it via code

_Assets/Scripts/Stage/StageManager.cs_<br />
The StageManager class is responsible for controlling what gets presented to the camera on stage. It can set up the next car that is going to be shown, and then rotate the stage to present it in front of the camera. The StageManager also controls accessory presentation via the currently selected car.

_Assets/Scripts/Stage/Car/Car.cs_<br />
The Car class is used to store the car's details, set its color, as well as accessory slots that can be populated with accessories from the accessory pool.

_Assets/Scripts/Stage/Car/CarColorMaterial.cs_<br />
Defines materials that can be applied to cars or accessories. We generally refer to these as 'color'

_Assets/Scripts/Stage/Car/ColorableCarPart.cs_<br />
A collection of models that make up the car, which get coloured on the Car Color Selector canvas. This is set up because we wanted to color individual car parts independently, however due to time constraints this feature is incomplete and was left out. Currently any components of the car that are colourable should be set up as a single part.

_Assets/Scripts/Stage/Car/ColorableCarpartComponent.cs_<br />
Attach this to any component of the car that should be colorable. We use this to allow the ColorableCarPart class to only accept ColorableCarPartComponents in the inspector as opposed to gameObjects or Transforms, to avoid accidentally dragging in non-colorable parts or any other gameobjects

_Assets/Scripts/Stage/Car/Spin.cs_<br />
Can be attached to a gameobject to slowly rotate it around the y-axis. Currently used by cars as they are presented on stage.

_Assets/Scripts/Stage/Car/Accessories/Accessory.cs_<br />
Used to store some information about each accessory such as price, and for setting colors

_Assets/Scripts/Stage/Car/Accessories/AccessoryPart.cs_<br />
Stores the default color for each part of an accessory

_Assets/Scripts/Stage/Car/Accessories/AccessorySlot.cs_<br />
Attached to a car gameobject, used to select or deselect accessories. Its transform determines how an accessory in the slot should be positioned relative to the car.

_Assets/Scripts/UI/Catalogue.cs_<br />
Controls visibility of the car catalogue and populates the car/accessory list at runtime based on the cars and accessories available in the scene

_Assets/Scripts/UI/NavArrowBtn.cs_<br />
Used to toggle whether a navigation arrow can be clicked or not. We want to disable it when there's only one car or one accessory available

_Assets/Scripts/UI/SpecsPanel.cs_<br />
Used to visualise the visible car's specs with animated bars on transitions between cars
